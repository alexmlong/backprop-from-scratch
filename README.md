# backprop-from-scratch

https://github.com/alexmlong/backprop-from-scratch

My attempt to implement back propagation from scratch. I did use online resources but I did not use any AI tools and did not use tutorials that actually provided code. I only used resources that talked about back prop at a conceptual level and then tried to implement it based on my understanding.

Key resources used:

*Code intentionally left messy* - I wanted to give a somewhat "organic" view on my development process as I created this. As such, I've left many of the pseudocode comments or thinking-out-loud that I did in the code.
